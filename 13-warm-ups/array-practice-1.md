# Array practice (part 1)

Complete the following exercises to improve your understanding of javascript functions!

Tests for each of these have been written and can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/davified/array-practice-1). Fork and git clone it to make use of the tests! Detailed instructions in the test repo.

1. Write a JavaScript function which accept a number as input and insert dashes (-) between each two even numbers.
  * Sample input: 025486
  * Sample output: 0-254-8-6

2. Write a Javascript function to find the most frequent item of an array. It should return a string denoting the item and the number of times it occurs in the array.
  * Sample input: [3, 'a', 'a', 'a', 2, 3, 'a', 3, 'a', 2, 4, 9, 3];
  * Sample output : 'a (5 times)'

3. Write a Javascript function to remove duplicate items from an array (ignore case sensitivity).
  * Sample input : [1, 'a', 'A', 'b', 2, 2]
  * Sample output: [1, 'a', 'b', 2]

4. Write a Javascript function to compute the union of two arrays.

  * Sample input: union([1, 2, 3], [100, 2, 1, 10])
  * Sample output: [1, 2, 3, 10, 100]

5. Write a JavaScript function to merge two arrays and removes all duplicates elements.

  * Sample input: merge_array([1, 2, 3], [2, 30, 1])
  * Sample output: [3, 2, 30, 1]
