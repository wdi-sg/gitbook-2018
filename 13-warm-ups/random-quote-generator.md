# Random Quote Generator

Build a random quote generator that randomly displays a quote on the page. Use this [random quote generator `api`](https://market.mashape.com/andruxnet/random-famous-quotes). Make sure that you've *signed up and created an application* before you try to use the `api`.

User stories:
* When user clicks a button, use `jQuery` to call `random-famous-quotes` api
* The output of that `ajax` call, update it into your html

### Bonus

* Randomize between different category the `api` (either `movies` or `famous`)
* Feel free to adjust the styling as you wish, try to apply your `jQuery` methods into it.
* Add a [`click to Tweet`](https://dev.twitter.com/web/overview) button that takes the current quote and opens it in a separate tab, letting the user tweet the quote (if user is logged in to Twitter).
