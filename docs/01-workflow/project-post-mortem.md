## Project Post Mortem
Post mortems are important to understand about what happened in a project and actively think about what you learned.

Post-mortems are meant to be a blame-less space open to objective conversation about what went well and what could be improved.

Even in the examples below, where tens of millions of dollars could be lost, the best approach is to think through the series of events that led to the outcome.

Large mistakes are almost never the fault of the developer, but of the sytems and processes in place to prevent errors and problems.
